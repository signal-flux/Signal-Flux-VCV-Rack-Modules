# Signal Flux VCV Rack Modules

Signal Flux is a collection of absolutely no-frills, elementary modules designed for teaching the fundamentals of modular synthesis in a step-by-step manner.

## Modules

**Simple Knob** : Generates a constant, unipolar voltage that is proportional to the knob position; sweeps over the range (0V,10V).

**Bipolar Knob** : Generates a constant, bipolar voltage that is proportional to the knob position; sweeps over the range (-5V,+5V).

## Updates

### V1.0.1

Adds **Bipolar Knob**

Adds titles to panel graphics.

### v1.0.0
